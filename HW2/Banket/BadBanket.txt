This is due to lack of coordination among threads. The getserving() method of BadPot is not synchronized so multiple threads can enter it at the same time. As the variable "servings" is not updated in mutual exclusion, servings may run out after a thread(savage) checks that there are enough servings and thus savages could eat out of an empty pot.
